n is designed to fill a memory area with a constant byte. It takes a pointer to a memory area, a constant byte, and the number of bytes to fill. This function leverages the standard library function `memset` to perform the memory-filling operation. It is a simple utility function commonly used in C programming to initialize or set the content of a memory region to a specified value.

## Usage

To use the `_memset` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary header file (e.g., `main.h`) that contains the function prototype.

2. Call the `_memset` function with the following parameters:
   - `s`: A pointer to the memory area to be filled.
   - `b`: The constant byte to fill the memory area with.
   - `n`: The number of bytes to fill with the constant byte.

3. The function will return a pointer to the memory area `s` after it has been filled.
