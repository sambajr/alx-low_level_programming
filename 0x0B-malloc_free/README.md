Welcome to the Magical Character Array Factory! 🪄

Do you need a spellbinding array of characters to brighten up your code? Look no further, for we have the perfect wizardry just for you! ✨

## ✨ What is this mystical creation? ✨

Introducing the "create_array" function – a magical concoction that allows you to craft an enchanting array of characters. Whether you want to summon a string of stars, an army of smiley faces, or a trail of unicorns in your code, this function has got you covered!

## 🪄 How does it work? 🪄

Simply provide two ingredients:
1. `size` - The number of characters you desire in your array.
2. `c` - The character you want to sprinkle into each element.

And presto! The function will conjure up your array and infuse every element with the chosen character. 🧙‍♂️✨

## 🪄 Sample Incantation 🪄

```c
char *myArray = create_array(10, '*');

This incantation creates an array with 10 enchanting '*' characters! The possibilities are endless; let your imagination run wild! 🌠

🌟 But wait, there's more! 🌟
If you attempt to summon an array of size 0, fear not, the function will gracefully provide you with a NULL pointer – your code's safety net.
If you accidentally misfire a negative size, the function will still keep you safe with another NULL pointer.
✨ Get Started! ✨
To wield the power of the "create_array" function, simply include the "main.h" header in your code and cast your own spell to make your projects more fun and engaging! 🪄🔮

🚀 Go ahead, sprinkle some magic into your code! 🚀
🧙‍♂️ May your coding adventures be filled with enchanting arrays and endless possibilities! 🧙‍♀️
