# Binary to Unsigned Int Converter

## Overview

This simple C function, `binary_to_uint`, converts a binary number represented as a string of '0' and '1' characters into an unsigned integer. The function is designed to handle various scenarios and provides meaningful error handling.

## Features

- Converts binary strings to unsigned integers.
- Handles invalid characters gracefully, returning 0 for any character other than '0' or '1'.
- Supports NULL input, returning 0 in such cases.

## Usage

To use this function in your C program, include the `binary_to_uint` function and call it with a binary string:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "binary_converter.h"  // Replace with the actual header file name

int main() {
    const char *binaryString = "1101";
    unsigned int result = binary_to_uint(binaryString);

    if (result == 0) {
        printf("Invalid binary string or NULL input.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Decimal equivalent: %u\n", result);
    }

    return 0;
}
Installation
No specific installation is required. Simply include the binary_converter.h header file in your project.

Example
c
Copy code
const char *binaryString = "10101";
unsigned int result = binary_to_uint(binaryString);

if (result == 0) {
    printf("Invalid binary string or NULL input.\n");
} else {
    printf("Decimal equivalent: %u\n", result);
}
