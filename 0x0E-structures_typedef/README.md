## Introduction

Welcome to the world of the Funky Dog Struct! This is not your ordinary dog; it's a wild, fun-loving, and groovy data structure that can hold information about your four-legged friends.

## What is a Funky Dog?

A "Funky Dog" is a custom data structure designed to capture the essence of your canine companions. It consists of the following unique attributes:

- **name**: A cool and hip character string that defines your dog's identity.
- **age**: A float that represents how young or old your dog is. We like to keep it chill with decimal ages.
- **owner**: The human responsible for all the funky adventures your dog embarks on.

## How to Use the Funky Dog Struct

1. **Initialization**: To create a new funky dog, you can declare a variable of type `struct dog` and assign values to its attributes like so:

```c
struct dog myFunkyDog;
myFunkyDog.name = "Disco";
myFunkyDog.age = 3.5;
myFunkyDog.owner = "Funky Fred";
A. Accessing Attributes: You can access the attributes of your funky dog using dot notation:
printf("Name: %s\n", myFunkyDog.name);
printf("Age: %.1f\n", myFunkyDog.age);
printf("Owner: %s\n", myFunkyDog.owner);
