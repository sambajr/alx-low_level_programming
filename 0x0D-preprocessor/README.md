# Header File with SIZE Macro

This repository contains a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024. This can be useful in C and C++ programming to improve code readability and maintainability by replacing numeric constants with meaningful names.

## Usage

Follow these steps to create and use the `size_macro.h` header file in your C or C++ programs:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the Repository:
cd <repository_name>
Create the Header File:

Create a new header file named size_macro.h in your project directory or include it in your existing project.
#define SIZE 1024
Include the Header File:

In your C or C++ source files where you want to use the SIZE macro, include the size_macro.h header at the beginning of the file.

c
Copy code
#include "size_macro.h"
Use the SIZE Macro:

You can now use the SIZE macro in your code. For example, if you need to define an array of 1024 elements, you can do so as follows:

c
Copy code
int data[SIZE];
This makes your code more readable and easier to maintain, as you can easily update the SIZE macro in one place (the size_macro.h header) if needed.

Example
Here's an example of how you can use the SIZE macro in your code:

c
Copy code
#include "size_macro.h"

int main() {
    int data[SIZE];
    // ...
    return 0;
}
