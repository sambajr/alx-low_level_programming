Doubly Linked Lists Project
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the implementation of various operations on doubly linked lists. Each file corresponds to a specific operation.

Files and Descriptions
0-print_dlistint.c
Prints all elements of a doubly linked list and returns the number of nodes.

1-dlistint_len.c
Returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.

2-add_dnodeint.c
Adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.

3-add_dnodeint_end.c
Adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.

4-free_dlistint.c
Frees a doubly linked list.

5-get_dnodeint.c
Returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.

6-sum_dlistint.c
Returns the sum of all elements in a doubly linked list.

7-insert_dnodeint.c
Inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.

8-delete_dnodeint.c
Deletes the node at a specified index in a doubly linked list.
