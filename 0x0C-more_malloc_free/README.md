#The Awesome Memory Allocation Duo ðŸš€

Welcome to the world of dynamic memory allocation with our fantastic functions! We promise they won't just allocate memory; they'll also allocate a big smile on your face. ðŸ’«

## Functions That Rock Your Memory World

### 1. `malloc_checked(unsigned int b)`

You've got a desire for memory? We've got you covered! This function allocates memory using `malloc` and ensures you get your fair share of bytes. But, beware, if `malloc` decides to take a vacation, we'll send it a message with status code 98. We take memory allocation very seriously!

### 2. `str_concat(char *s1, char *s2)`

Need to concatenate two strings without breaking a sweat? Look no further! Our `str_concat` function will merge two strings into one, making you the master of text fusion. It's string concatenation made as easy as mixing peanut butter and jelly!

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo - "TheAwesomeMemoryAllocationDuo"
2. Include our header file `main.h` in your project.
3. Call our memory allocation functions and let the magic begin!

```c
#include "main.h"

int main(void) {
    char *result = str_concat("Hello", " World");
    printf("%s\n", result);
    free(result);
    return (0);
}
